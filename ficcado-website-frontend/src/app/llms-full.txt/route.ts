## 1. Brand Story, Ethos & Craftsmanship

Ficcado was founded in 2025 by three close friends who refused to accept paper-thin fast fashion and overpriced synthetic apparel. Frustrated by the lack of high-quality streetwear that balanced true structural weight, rich tailored colors, and durability without a 400% markup, they pooled their resources, visited spinning mills across the subcontinent, and developed custom 230 GSM combed cotton weaves with relaxed drop-shoulder unisex cuts.

### Core Philosophy
- "People's own brand" — transparent materials, limited capsule drops, and garments engineered to become the favorite staple in your wardrobe.
- Zero shortcuts on yarn weight, stitch density, or ethical wages.
- "Clothing shouldn't be disposable. It should feel reassuringly heavy when you put it on, look effortless on the street, and stay just as vibrant years later."

### Trust & Quality Pillars
1. **230 GSM High Quality:** Dense custom combed cotton weaves that keep structure wash after wash.
2. **100% Quality Inspected:** Every garment is hand-verified before dispatch from our facility.
3. **7-Day Transparent Returns:** Risk-free home try-on. If the drape or fit isn't right, doorstep pickup is provided.
4. **WhatsApp Dispatch Updates:** Direct dispatch alerts and courier AWB tracking links sent directly to your WhatsApp.

### Leadership & Founding Team
- **Sinan MS**: Co-Founder & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) — Executive decision-maker, strategic vision, and brand direction.
- **Ganga Lakshmi**: Co-Founder & Operations & Creative Officer — Creative direction, campaigns, apparel concepts, and operations.
- **Rohith Murali**: Co-Founder & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) — Financial strategy, budgets, expenses, and strategic grounding.

### Engineering & Technical Architecture
- **Arjun PS**: Lead Full-Stack Architect & Developer — Engineered the headless Google Sheets database integration, Next.js 16 App Router architecture, responsive UI, search engine optimization, and AI discoverability frameworks.
